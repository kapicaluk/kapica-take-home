# When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?

> **Edge Functions**: 
> - Use Edge Functions for content personalization and processes that run close to the user, such as instant traffic congestion updates.
>
> **Serverless Functions**: 
> - Good for handling API requests, form submissions, and other compute-intensive tasks that aren't needed very frequently. They allow you to pay only for the compute power used, without the overhead of managing servers.
>
> **Edge Middleware**: 
> - Ideal for modifying requests before they reach the application. For example, a worldwide e-commerce site that serves different products in various countries could utilize Edge Middleware to show different products depending on the location.
