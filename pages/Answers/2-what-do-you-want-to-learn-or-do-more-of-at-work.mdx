# What do you want to learn or do more of at work? 

I'm eager to dive deeper into complex system issues, especially those impacting user experience. I aim to not only resolve these issues as they arise but also develop preventative strategies to boost system reliability and performance.

Additionally, I want to play a larger role in product development. By collaborating closely with engineering and product teams and harnessing real user feedback, I plan to refine and improve product features continuously. This approach will help us craft more durable, user-focused solutions.

In the long term, I hope to transition into a software engineering role, utilizing my deep understanding of technical challenges and product enhancements to contribute more directly to our product architecture and design. I think that Senior Customer Success Engineer role at Vercel would be a great stepping stone towards this goal. 

By assessing technical trends and user challenges, I aim to drive product enhancements that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future demands, fostering ongoing innovation and growth. This strategic involvement not only tackles immediate technical issues but also sets the stage for a future in software engineering, where I can make a significant, lasting impact on our products.
